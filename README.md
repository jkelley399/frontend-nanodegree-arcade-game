# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## Introduction
This project is being submitted in connection with part 5, "Object-Oriented Javascript," of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.   *See*: ["Project: Classic Arcade Game Clone, Project Overview"](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd001/parts/5b433748-71ae-488f-8eba-f102160cd17b/modules/794adb78-22bb-4a38-85cd-6fa148ebc28a/lessons/64d2cad8-b230-41da-ba90-5b74f33176cc/concepts/25968188800923).  This project is based upon the starter code.  *See*: ["udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game"](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).  Only very minimal additional functionality has been added at this time, including:

*   a very simple `window.alert` providing notification when a player has won.

## TODO

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
